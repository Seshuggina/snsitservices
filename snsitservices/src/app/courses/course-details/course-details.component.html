        <p>
            To run the business processes smoothly and efficiently, there are continuous updates in software
            developmental approach. DevOps is such a tool which has assured exceptional, swifter and productive services
            with a high-end customer satisfaction. DevOps have become a flair in the recent IT market. Consequently, the
            demand for engineers to develop, supervise and deal DevOps practices is on a raise in organizations of
            various industries. To meet this demand and raise their own efficiency, organizations are hiring skilled
            DevOps engineers. In order to avail this booming opportunity, one must be aware about what a DevOps does and
            the required prerequisites. DevOps certification can vastly improve your employment prospects and your role
            within the organisation. A DevOps engineer should have the skills of both a developer and an operations
            engineer. These include a knowledge of programming languages, automation tools, and operations processes

        <h4>INTRODUCTION:</h4>
        <p>
            DevOps (Development Operations) is a pioneer innovative development method comprising of just a few sets of
            processes that synchronize to integrate development teams and processes to supplement software development.
            DevOps is making the software development lifecycle shorter and more robust by combining the responsibility
            of development and operations into one role. A strong alliance of divergent teams- developing, testing, and
            operating- is its distinguished concept. This strong collaboration of teams results in identifying and
            solving errors quickly. In the DevOps scenario, the codes are continuously developed, tested, integrated,
            deployed and monitored to provide the standard output in less duration.

        <h4>PRE-REQUISITES:</h4>
        <p>
            DevOps training will cover a lot of topics related to both development and operations. However, prior
            knowledge of some of the basics will not only make it easier to understand the course contents, but it will
            also ensure that you ace the certification exam. Here are the DevOps training prerequisites
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Knowledge on programming languages : It's essential to have a basic knowledge on certain basic
                programming languages such as Java, Perl, and Python. This ensures to deal well with the development
                team so as to allow smooth flow of application installation, configuration and validation.</li>
            <li>Understanding Tools and Technologies: Specific DevOps tools are the key elements to perform different
                operations of development, testing, integration, monitoring, deployment and others. One should have
                basic understanding the popular tools like GIT, Selenium, Jenkins, Docker, Puppet, Chef, Ansible, ELK
                Stack and Splunk. He or she should be interested to aspire learning new technologies, provide unique
                solutions and suggestions, and ready to face challenges.</li>
            <li>Operations Processes: IT operations form one half of DevOps. Therefore, DevOps certification eligibility
                also includes knowledge of basic operation activities such as taking backups, testing, performing
                maintenance, etc.</li>
            <li>DevOps Training and Certification: One of the most important prerequisites of the engineer is DevOps
                training and certification. It provides an effective path to learn different concepts of DevOps -
                fundamentals, DevOps tools, lifecycle, workflow, and various processes. Certification as DevOps
                professional upgrades the skills and abilities to improve business scope.</li>
        </ul>
