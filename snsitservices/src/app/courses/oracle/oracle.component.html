        <p>
            Oracle Database (commonly referred to as Oracle DBMS or simply as Oracle) is a multi-model database management system produced and marketed by Oracle Corporation.
        </p>
        
        <p>Oracle is the most popular RDBMS. It is one of the most demanding database management systems. It is the biggest database technology. In the market for relational databases, Oracle Database competes against commercial products such as IBM's DB2 UDB and Microsoft SQL Server. Oracle and IBM tend to battle for the mid-range database market on Unix and Linux platforms, while Microsoft dominates the mid-range database market on Microsoft Windows platforms.</p>
       
        <p>Oracle is a collection of data and the utilization of SQL queries. Oracle is used in many of the organizations for storing and retrieving the structural data. Oracle online training helps to learn both the SQL as well as Pl/SQL. SQL Developer, PL/SQL Developer, Toad, etc are some examples of third-party tools that make it easier to use Database for SQL and PL/SQL work.</p>

        <h4>INTRODUCTION:</h4>
        <p>
            An Oracle database is a collection of data treated as a unit. The purpose of a database is to store and retrieve related information. The primary purpose of a database is to store and retrieve related information.
        </p>
        <p>Oracle Database is the first database designed for enterprise grid computing, the most flexible and cost effective way to manage information and applications. Enterprise grid computing creates large pools of industry-standard, modular storage and servers. With this architecture, each new system can be rapidly provisioned from the pool of components. There is no need for peak workloads, because capacity can be easily added or reallocated from the resource pools as needed. The database has logical structures and physical structures. Because the physical and logical structures are separate, the physical storage of data can be managed without affecting the access to logical storage structures.</p>
        <p>A database server is the key to solving the problems of information management. In general, a server reliably manages a large amount of data in a multiuser environment so that many users can concurrently access the same data. All this is accomplished while delivering high performance. A database server also prevents unauthorized access and provides efficient solutions for failure recovery.</p>
        <p>Oracle consists of various software mechanisms to achieve maximized data concurrency, high performance, and maximum productivity for a multi-user database environment.</p>
