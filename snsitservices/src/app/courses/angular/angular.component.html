        <p>
            From social media to healthcare, from ecommerce to online banking, billions of people worldwide use web and mobile applications for almost everything. These apps are convenient and help us with our day-to-day lives, offering seamless user experiences and interfaces. How are these apps developed to provide such reliability? Part of the credit goes to widely used frameworks like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.simplilearn.com/why-learn-angular-career-benefits-of-angular-certification-article">Angular</a>, making it easy to create robust apps. Angular redefines the modern JavaScript virtual machine by turning templates into code. Thus, your hand-written code can leverage on a productive framework. The best thing about Angular is that you can render the code into HTML & CSS and have the first view of the application on any other platform like NodeJS.

        <h4>INTRODUCTION:</h4>
        
        <p>
            Angular is an open-source, JavaScript framework written in TypeScript. Google maintains it, and its primary purpose is to develop single-page applications. First introduced in 2009, the framework has gained huge traction over the years for eliminating unnecessary code and ensuring lighter & faster apps. Angular helps build interactive and dynamic single page applications (SPAs) with its compelling features including templating, two-way binding, modularization, RESTful API handling, dependency injection, and AJAX handling. Designers can use HTML as template language and even extend HTMLâ€™ syntax to easily convey the components of the application. As a framework, Angular has clear advantages while also providing a standard structure for developers to work with. It enables users to create large applications in a maintainable manner.
