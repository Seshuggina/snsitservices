            Angular is an open-source, JavaScript framework written in TypeScript. Google maintains it, and its primary purpose is to develop single-page applications. First introduced in 2009, the framework has gained huge traction over the years for eliminating unnecessary code and ensuring lighter & faster apps. Angular helps build interactive and dynamic single page applications (SPAs) with its compelling features including templating, two-way binding, modularization, RESTful API handling, dependency injection, and AJAX handling. Designers can use HTML as template language and even extend HTMLâ€™ syntax to easily convey the components of the application. As a framework, Angular has clear advantages while also providing a standard structure for developers to work with. It enables users to create large applications in a maintainable manner.
