        <p>
            Java is one of the world's most important and widely used computer languages, and it has held this
            distinction for many years. Unlike some other computer languages whose influence has weared with passage of
            time, while Java's has grown.
        </p>

        <p>Java was developed by James Ghosling, Patrick Naughton, Mike Sheridan at Sun Microsystems Inc. in 1991, later
            acquired by Oracle Corporation. It took 18 months to develop the first working version.The initial name was
            Oak but it was renamed to Java in 1995 as OAK was a registered trademark of another Tech company.
        </p>
        <p>Java is an Object Oriented Programming Language. Core Java is a concept to write once can be used anywhere.
            Without compiling the code it can be used on another platform if it the code is written for one platform.
            Java can be used in both Client Server as well as Web-based Application. We can use Core Java in many
            technologies like Selenium, Hadoop, Sales Force, Data Analytics, etc. It has the different concept of
            Collection, Swing, Multi-threading, etc which help in the building of Stand-Alone Application. It is very
            flexible and can be used to develop Software as well as Applets. It is also used to develop a Mobile
            Application, Desktop Application, Web Application, Security driven Application, etc.

        <h4>INTRODUCTION:</h4>
        <p>
            Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language and is designed to have as few implementation
            dependencies as possible. It is a simple programming language. Java makes writing, compiling, and debugging
            programming easy. It helps to create reusable code and modular programs.
        </p>
        <p>Java applications are compiled to byte code that can run on any Java Virtual Machine. The syntax of Java is
            similar to c/c++.</p>

        <p>
            Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and a secure and stable programming language but it is not a
            pure object-oriented language because it supports primitive data types like int, char etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            Java is a platform-independent language because it has runtime environment i.e JRE and API. Here platform
            means a hardware or software environment in which anapplication runs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Java codes are compiled into byte code or machine-independent code. This byte code is run on JVM (Java
            Virtual Machine).
        </p>
        <p>
            The syntax is Java is almost the same as C/C++. But java does not support low-level programming functions
            like pointers. The codes in Java is always written in the form of Classes and objects.
        </p>
